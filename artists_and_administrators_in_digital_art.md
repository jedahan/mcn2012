# [The Role of Artists and Administrators in a Digital World][]

## Socially Networked Arts Group #ArtsTech @jackomo

  We work across organizations, not stuck inside a building

  networks/meetups/festivals
  * #artsec
  * fffff.at

  * UPGRADE! (nyc 1999)

  * rhizome
  * turbulence
  * dance-net

  * burningman
  * zero1

  * eyebeam

	Question: So there are a ton of meetups. From mailing lists (upgrade is still running?), to meetup.com, to dorkbots, etc. Where are there resources for cross-pollination? Is that even a problem? For people outside the know, its hard to get in. Once in, its easy, word of mouth.

	Answer: good idea, artstech won't do it but maybe someone will. or maybe things will turn into rhizome, meh?


## Digital Blur @caw_

* Marcelle Duchamp
* Robert Rauschenberg
* M?? Cunningham

## Projects
    
### PINTERESET
grab pintrest photostreams, autocollage + add mess

### BIT-ROT
a photo gallery where every time you access the file it gets messier and messier. modifies the original image.

* research - photo of photos in state of deterioation (ask conservation / image conservatory)

### like lightning field
show what exists in the ether (illustrate invisible networks, radio)

* modify to be like cthulu

### augmented reality
start modifying peoples behavoir (see wall that makes it harder to walk to work)

### audioguide
that requires you to wear a blindfold and navigate the museum?

DANGER!
-------

  commission artists to fill out a space - look at where the piece will be around

  commission poets to give reflections on the collection : non-fiction/fiction

  ncartmuseum.org/speakup

  * MISINTERPRETATION?? branded head. returns were low.

  * Such great questions - are you commissioning a piece from an artists, or contracting a designer?
  	* with an artist, you grant freedom and deal with the results
      * with a designer, ????  (are you developing a solution?)
