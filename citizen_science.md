=================

Part I @elyw
------

What is citizen science? 
  participatory, not new, needs open data

What problems might there be?
  museums are afraid of putting their dirty data out there for others to clean up

What are some examples of getting science in the museums?
  atlas of living australia, sharing biodiversity knowledge. they ask for species sighting from anyone.
  biodiversity volunteer portal, crowsourced digitization of labels!
  gathering data from mobile apps (iSpy Frogs, frogs field guide, LEAFSNAP!)

What are some examples of getting museum science out?
  museumvictoria-field-guide, open source
  	by open sourcing, there are two apps being built from that one
  		one benefit is the other apps will be using some of the same format
  	bunurong field guide
  		free re-use of the images since its from their own library
  		also open source
  		ported to android
  	Benefits:
  	  On the basis of free apps, they brought in 500,000 of grant money

Part II @arfw? (zooniverse)
-------

More examples:
	Cornel Lab of Ornithology
	volunteer computing is not citizen science, because its passive

Spectrum of using the cognitive surplus (clay shirky)
  | lolcats -> eBird
   communal -> civic |
  and everything in between, cognitive surplus is not exclusive for one side or the other

Identifying galaxies
	Compare authority with a crowdsourcer who seems legit, and then give them authority to compare with third party citizen scientists to make sure 

oldWeather (is.gd/oldww1)
	digitizing ships logs from royal navy vessels (HMS New Zealand)
	every 4 hours the ships record the weather. part of daily operations. part of the legal record. AWESOME!
	military time, precision. OCR error fixing just as much time as typing out by hand.

What to be sure to do when working with the public
	Collaborators not users
  		(175,000 people cited as author list on paper; got rejected haha)
  	Contribute to real research
  		not to make educational tools, do REAL SCIENCE
  	Don't waste people's time
  		if theres another way to do this, thats as effective, use it!

seafloor explorer
	non-invasive way of measuring scallop populations to establish quotas for fishing :)

Bat Detective
	existing automated methods are proprietary, expensive, and not so good
	exists to create a good enough training set of data so that we can automate determining what made what sounds?

WHY DO CITIZEN SCIENCE?
	scale (take on big research questions)
	accuracy (measurable confidence. 90% people agree this galaxy is a spiral galaxy)
	education (producing lesson plans)
	serendipity (people look at a collection of data, they notice the unusual)


Part III
--------
  http://eol.org/api
  	make personalized field guide, upload them, share

ALL PARTS CONSIDERED
--------------------

# Projects
  
  * Data cleanup - how long has TMS consolidation taken? How much more estimated? What if we let the world 'fix' our data. Maybe provide badges, leaderboards. Lets talk to wikimedia about this.

  * Digitization - take pictures of our labels and have the world transcribe

  * uncovering secrets
  	show xrays and alternate views of art, have people look for cracks or sketches of stuff?

  * FACILITATED citizen science (citizen science sunday) works well with some projects
    tell me and i forget, show me and i remember, involve me and I understand

  * Guerilla transcription
  	inject transcription on pages that lack data access
  	>>>>>> shiftspace <<<<<<

# Questions

  * citizen science, closest to history, for art museums? still do real research i guess?

  * not obvious how to translate what has been done online, to in-gallery museum experience
  	musuem science on the floor = 10,000 clicks, not bad but not great
  	'to inspire explanation and understanding of the universe'

  * is your museum's website just a digital leaflet

  * what are design tips
  	keep the voice of the researcher front and center
  	make a personal connection with the researcher or team you are helping
  	  NOT 'come see galaxies no person has ever seen before'
  	  YES 'you have changed the way we do research'
