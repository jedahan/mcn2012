The Future of Collection Management Systems #mcn2012cms
===========================================


collecting things @roblancefield
-----------------

why we collect, as individuals and museums
why were there only 1000 objects online? (as a design museum)
blog was for a scratchpad of what we were working on
  but more importantly what we *wanted* to do
  it built momentum (especially when getting comments/feedback)

steps to make a collections site
  reduce minimum criteria
  give the collection away

  could not license images as cc0...so, metadata shows url to images


TMS @thisisaaronland
---

  moving away from a singular narrative motive to
    a place where not only scholars but to laypeople

  TMS will remain the source of truth for the forseeable future
    emuseum was thrown under the bus

  writing everything ourself, NOT building a platform
    open source whatever we can
      writing for ourselves

  we have better things to do than encode relationship data and what can be said and whom can access it

  TMS is a set of social contracts of how we talk about our collection

  * 'to listen to people talk about their collections in the terms of the shadows that their data in the database cast' is terrifying

  start with the data

  PHP works and is fast but only because its the best supported on apache, which we chose because we chose it. //WTF?

  the point of the internet is so 
    'WE CAN CONNECT OURS TO THEIRS'

swiss army knife @???
----------------

  their CMS records arguments, neat
  do not make a distinction between the format - digital or not, if its in the collection, its managed by the CMS
  'some decisions more political than technical': does that apply to us?

  collecting intangible heritage
  	tech, games, communication, dance, language, stories, rituals

  we have changed some digitized video change tags to be a collection object, instead of the original format
  (in regards to adding Preservation to DAMs)

  co-created content will be museum's responsibility to collect & preserve
  	QUESTION: even stuff from other networks? do you re-implement twitter?
  		what is important for future generations to be able to replay?
  		what context do they want/need?
  		virtual machine everything?
